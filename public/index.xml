      <description>This is the first part of the VC Dimension and Neural Networks series. Basic definition and some examples of vc dimension of learning algorithms are explained here.
1. Definition Let $S=\{x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_m\}$ be the set of m random points from $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\mathscr{H}$ be a class of $\{-1,+1\}$ valued functions on $\mathbb{R}^d$ i.e $$\forall \\, h \in H, h:S \to \{0,1\}^m$$ One such example is $h_1(x_i)=1 \,\forall \, x_i \in S$. In the context of Machine Learning, $\mathscr{H}$ is the learning algorithm generally used for any classification task such as Logistic Regression etc.</description>

      <description>1. What is Point Cloud? A Point Cloud is a set of points in 3D space which can represent the boundary or the whole object (including inside points). In a point cloud, the points are unordered and are not restricted by any grid which means a point cloud can be expressed in an infinite way (using translation). Each point can have 3D coordinates and feature vectors. $$ P={(X_i,F_i)}^{i=N}_{i=1}, X_i\in\mathbb{R}^3,F_i\in\mathbb{R}^d$$</description>

      <description>This is the second part of the VC Dimension and Neural Networks series. This part lists important theorems with proofs and explanations. To know the basics of VC dimension, check Part 1 - VC Dimension - Definition and Examples.
1. Definitions $\textbf{Dichotomy}:$ A dichotomy of $S=\{x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_m\}$ induced by $h \in \mathscr{H}$ is a partition of S into two disjoint sets $S_1$ and $S_2$ such that $$h(x_i)=\begin{cases} 1 \, \text{if} \, x_i \in S_1 \\ -1 \, \text{if} \, x_i \in S_2\\ \end{cases}$$ Let $\mathscr{H}(S)$ be the set of all labelings or dichotomies that can be realized by $\mathscr{H}$.</description>

      <title>Part 2 - Point Cloud Segmentation</title>

      <description>Point Cloud Segmentation Methods Point Cloud Segmentation is the task for grouping objects or assigning labels to every points in the point cloud. It is one of the most challenging tasks and a research topic in deep learning since point clouds are noisy, unstructured and lack connectedness property. All the methods are categorized into four categories.
1. Edge Based Methods Edges describe the intrinsic characteristics of the boundary of any 3D object.</description>

      <description>This is the third part of the VC Dimension and Neural Networks series. This part discusses the important theorems for vc dimension of MLPs. Please read Part 2: VC Dimension - Theorems and Lemmas for the important theorems that will be used here.
1. Important Notation Abbreviation Meaning $NN$ Neural Networks $MLP$ Multilayer Perceptrons 2. Theorem 1 - Separable Regions In this theorem we will see how MLPs divides a space into different regions and classify accordingly.</description>

      <title>Learning Shapes for Efficient Segmentation of 3D Medical Images using Point Cloud</title>

      <description>Abstract In this report, we present a novel approach for 3D medical image segmentation using point clouds. 3D Convolutional Neural Networks have been the most dominating networks in medical image processing but they require large memory footprints and training samples. Hence we used point clouds to represent the image instead of voxels. Point clouds are lightweight and contain shape and smoother surface information. We extracted the point clouds from 3D voxel images using canny edge detection.</description>

      <title>Vignette detection and reconstruction of composed ornaments with a strengthened autoencoder</title>

      <description>Abstract A strengthened autoencoder formed by placing an object detector upstream of a decoder is here developed in the context of the model-helped human analysis of composed ornaments from a dictionary of vignettes. The detection part is in charge to detect regions of interest containing some vignette features, and the decoding part to ensure vignette reconstruction with a relative quality depending on feature match. Images of ornaments without typographical composition are generated in order to properly assess the performance of each of the two parts.</description>
