## 1. Point Cloud
  ### A. Introduction
  A Point Cloud is a set of points in 3D space which can represent the boundary or the whole object (including inside points). In a point cloud, the points are unordered and are not restricted by any grid which means a point cloud can be expressed in an infinite way (using translation). Each point can have 3D coordinates and feature vectors. $$P=\{(X_i,F_i)\}^{i=N}_{i=1}, X_i\in\mathbb{R}^3,F_i\in\mathbb{R}^d$$
