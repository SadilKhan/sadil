Hello, My name is Mohammad Sadil Khan. I am currently pursuing a PhD degree with the [**German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI GmbH)**](https://av.dfki.de/members/sadil-khan/) and the [**University of Kaiserslautern-Landau (RPTU)**](https://rptu.de/), under the supervision of Prof. Dr Didier Stricker. 

My research interests are in **3D Reconstruction, Vision-Language Modeling and AI-Aided CAD Designing**. I love building new AI architectures and am very passionate about text-to-3D domain. Check out my [**Projects**](/projects) and [**Publications**](/publications/) page.


I am open to research collaboration as well as internship opportunity on the following domains
