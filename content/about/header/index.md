Hello, My name is Mohammad Sadil Khan. I am currently pursuing a PhD degree with the [**German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI GmbH)**](https://av.dfki.de/members/sadil-khan/) and the [**University of Kaiserslautern-Landau (RPTU)**](https://rptu.de/), under the supervision of Prof. Dr Didier Stricker. I am currently working on 3D Scene and Shape understanding with vision-language models and Computer-Aided Design(CAD) representation learning.

I have completed my Masters in **Machine Learning and Data Mining** from [**University Jean Monnet**](https://www.univ-st-etienne.fr/fr/index.html), Saint Etienne, France. I have also completed an exchange semester in [**KU Leuven**](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven), Belgium.

My research interests are in **Computer Vision, 3D Reconstruction and Vision-Language Modeling**. I am also interested in IOS Development. 

Check out my [**Projects**](/projects) and [**Publications**](/publications/) page.
